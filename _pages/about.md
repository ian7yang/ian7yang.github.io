Hello, my name is Zheng (Ian) Yang, a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Tech.

I am advised by [Prof. Wenke Lee](https://wenke.gtisc.gatech.edu/) and co-advised by [Prof. Brendan D. Saltaformaggio](https://saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu/). 

My research focuses on Web security, including forensic techniques on web-based attacks and real-time defense techniques against web-based attacks such as social engineering attacks, injection attacks, etc. Underpinning all of my research is the development of fundamental techniques for out-of-band browser instrumentation and program analysis on programming languages related to the web ecosystem.
